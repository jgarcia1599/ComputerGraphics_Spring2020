# CS-UH 2215 Foundations of Computer Graphics


Spring 2020          
Professor Saurabh Rayh    

# Course Description   

The aim of the course is to give an overview of the fundamental concepts in computer
graphics along with hands-on experience in interactive 3D graphics programming. The
course will cover basic mathematics related to computer graphics (geometric primitives,
2D and 3D transformations, orthographic and perspective projections), fundamentals of
geometric modeling (mesh representation and manipulation), the modern graphics
pipeline, shading and lighting models, mapping techniques (texture, bump,
environment), and ray tracing. Relevant basics of mathematics, algorithms and data
structures will also be covered in this course. However, prior experience in
programming will be very useful as the course is programming intensive.
